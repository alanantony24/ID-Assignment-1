# ID-Assignment-1
This is a repository for my ID Assignment One

The purpose of this webiste is to portray my portfolio webiste. It will contain information about my education and the skills I possess.

The webiste is mainly targeted at my future employers or teachers or anyone who want to know more about my 
personal life and qualifications. It acts as an online space for me to depict myself effectively in front 
of my employer / teacher.

As for what value this website will provide for the audience viewing it well, they can know about what my qualifications and skills are. They also get an insight into my personal information such as hobbies, interests etc. The webiste also innclude links to all of my social media profiles namely FaceBook, Instagram, Twitter and of course LinkedIn. All of these helps the audience understand me better and form a picture about who I am and what I do on a daily basis.

## Design Process

The design process mainly focused on creating a portfolio webiste that could be understood by basically anyone by providing bite sized information and properly structured pages. So in this case I thought using a 
Single Scroll Page is better because otherwise the user may have to navigate from page to page looking for information. 
Initially I created wireframes for multipage websites but it was later only that I came to know that I can use Single Scroll Page. So I edited the wireframe before the week 5 submission and made some changes. But over the course of coding the websites there were times I felt the need to add in more content so I added the content on the website but in the wireframe those are missing (eg.awards and acheivements).

### User Stories:

* As an employer / HR of the company, I would like to know more about Alan's qualifications and personal life.
* As a lecturer about to teach Alan I would like to know more about his behaviour and qualities he possess.
*As his collegue I want to know about his knowledge in these areas and porjects he's worked on.

I am not editing the wireframe again but I think the explanation is pretty straightforward. Also I did not do any artwork and all the graphics used in website are from sources on the internet.

## Features

### Existing Features
1. The user can use the navigation menu that is always present on the screen to move between section of the website.
2. Clear description of all the qualifications and projects.
3. User friendly design
4. Can be viewed on most screensizes

### Potential Features
1. A project wall to display all the projects
2. An animated skill meter to show how much knowledge I have in each skill

## Technologies Used

1.  JavaScript 
* I used JavaScript to hide the menu panel when not in use. Menu pops out when use clicks on the icon.

## Testing

I tested the websites on all the possible browsers that I could namely
Google Chrome
Mozilla FireFox
Opera
Microsoft Edge

The contact form has necessary validation and is working properly. The webiste caters to most screensizes however an interesting thing I noticed was:

1. When i first click Inspect, the webiste appears really big. Then when I change device to a Pixel and then back again to Iphone X the webiste is displayed properly.
2. The images of me and my friends are displayed in a funny way when viewed on Galaxy S5, iPad

All the other devices I noticed no issues.

## Credits

### Content

The content is my own information. I also added in a paragraph from a portfolio website I created earlier for myself.

### Media

The graphics were taken from random youtube video descriptions and other webistes such as Freepik, Flaticons and DevianArt.

### Acknowledgements

I recieved inspiration from some youtube videos namely Danni Krossing, Traversy Media, Easy Tutorias, Dev Ed, Web Dev Simplified. All these videos gave me a deeper understanding and helped me structure my webiste.
